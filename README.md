Spotify Tree
===============
A single page web app that allows users to search for a single artist and build a tree based on Spotify's Artist recommendations. Every artist node automatically generates 3 artist node children based on the top 3 recommended artists from Spotify's API. Clicking an artist node with no children generates 3 artists node children from that node. Users can continue to build groups of 3 branches at a time farther and farther down the tree.

Utilizes Spotify's oAuth and requires that the user sign into their Spotify account to proceed.
